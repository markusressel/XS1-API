# to set a completely new configuration for an actuator
# you have to get all of its configuration parameters right
# otherwise the request will fail

# it is also possible to update only part of a configuration
# but I was not able to find any documentation on what is possible

# this is just one example how to create a configuration
# configuration parameters can vary depending on the type and system of your device

# Tip: when using a dictionary to manually set values (like in this example)
# try to use UrlParam enum constants as keys to avoid typos

my_config = {}

# this is only one example

# first of all your configuration must specify the actuator/sensor id
# BUT this is done for you when calling the api method
# so you don't have to worry about that just yet

# Note: be aware of the character limitations of the xs1 though!
# when using the actuator.set_name() method this is checked automatically for you

# The library will automatically take care of that for you and convert them to the
# correct string representation for use in a http request

# provide a "connection" configuration for your device
# this can vary greatly between types and systems

# you can set a configuration for an actuator or sensor
# keep in mind though that parameters will be different for some types
